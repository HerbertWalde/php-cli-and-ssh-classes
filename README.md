php-cli-and-ssh-classes
=======================

A collection of (mostly static) classes providing robust and easy-to-use methods for interacting with filesystems and databases over ssh2 (and local as well). Additionally features the possibility to run shell commands interactively. If you want to build a website deployment system with PHP, then this is what you need.
